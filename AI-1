Hey %s,
    
I came across %s while browsing through %s and I noticed a couple negative reviewsâ€¦

My name is Thomas Shehadeh, and my company has a 5-minute trick to completely stop bad online reviews and you a few hundred extra customers through your door each week.

Can we schedule a quick 10-minute call and I can share more?

Let me know! :)

Cheers!
- Thomas Shehadeh""" %(ceo_name,company_name,source_name)
